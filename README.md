# LiveDrift â€“ Drift-Aware Stock Predictor

**Status:** *This project is currently in active development. Components will be implemented incrementally.*

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
**LiveDrift** is a real-time machine learning system designed to forecast short-term stock market trends while actively monitoring for model drift. The system automatically triggers retraining when performance degrades due to shifting market conditions.

Key features:
- Multiple data sources including market prices, sentiment analysis, and ESG scores.
- Automated ETL and model training pipelines with **Apache Airflow**.
- Drift detection using **Evidently AI** with retraining triggers.
- Real-time inference service powered by **FastAPI**, containerized in Docker.
- Observability and monitoring with **Prometheus & Grafana**.
- Web demo for live predictions and visualizations.

## ðŸ›  System Architecture
![System Architecture Diagram](path/to/diagram.png) <!-- Replace with actual image path -->

### 1. Data Sources
- **yfinance** â€“ Stock prices & technical indicators.
- **Financial Modeling Prep API** â€“ Stock news sentiment scores.
- **Finnhub API** â€“ ESG scores and market insights.

### 2. Data Warehouse
- Centralized storage in **Amazon S3** for raw and processed datasets.

### 3. Data Processing & Feature Engineering
- Data preprocessing for missing values, normalization, and transformations.
- Technical Analysis (TA) feature pipeline.

### 4. Model Training
- Choice of **LSTM** (for sequential modeling) or **XGBoost** (for speed & interpretability).
- Evaluation and registration in the **Model Registry**.

### 5. Drift Monitoring
- **Evidently AI** checks model performance and data distribution on regular intervals.
- Drift above threshold triggers retraining via Airflow.

### 6. Serving & Observability
- **FastAPI** inference service (Docker on AWS Lambda or alternative).
- Live demo (Streamlit â€“ maybe) for end-user interaction.
- Metrics & logs via **Prometheus & Grafana**.

### 7. Automation
- **Apache Airflow** schedules and orchestrates:
  - ETL pipeline
  - Model training
  - Drift checks and retraining triggers
