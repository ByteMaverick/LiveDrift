# LiveDrift - Stock Forecasting System

A comprehensive machine learning pipeline for stock price prediction with real-time monitoring and drift detection capabilities.

## Planned Components (Development in Progress)

### Data Pipeline
- **Live Data Ingestion**: Real-time stock data collection via `yfinance`
- **Feature Engineering**: Advanced technical indicators and volatility metrics
- **Data Validation**: Automated quality checks and preprocessing

### Hybrid Forecasting Models
- **LSTM Networks**: Sequential trend learning for long-term pattern recognition
- **XGBoost**: Feature-based ensemble learning for short-term predictions
- **Model Ensemble**: Combining both approaches for robust forecasting

### Drift Detection Module
Advanced monitoring system to detect changes in data patterns:
- **Statistical Tests**:
  - Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov Test for distribution comparison
  - Population Stability Index (PSI) for feature stability
- **Automated Responses**:
  - Alert notifications for significant drift
  - Automatic retraining workflows via Airflow DAGs

### Model Monitoring & Orchestration
- **Pipeline Management**: Complete ML workflow orchestration with `Apache Airflow`
- **Performance Tracking**: Continuous evaluation metrics logging
- **Automated Scheduling**: Regular model updates and validation cycles

### Future Enhancements

#### Real-time Monitoring Stack
- **Prometheus Integration**: Custom metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana Dashboards**: Real-time visualization of model performance and system health

#### MLOps Infrastructure
- **MLflow Integration**: Model registry and experiment tracking
- **Version Control**: Model versioning and rollback capabilities
- **A/B Testing**: Framework for comparing model variants

#### Explainability & Interpretability
- **LIME Integration**: Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations
- **SHAP Dashboard**: Feature importance and prediction explanations
- **Interactive Visualizations**: User-friendly explanation interface
